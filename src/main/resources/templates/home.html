<h2 align="center">Welcome to Dr. Doe's Personal Page</h2>
<p>
    Dr. Jane Doe is certainly a lot more than her cancer. She is very active as a mentor as a youth IT instructor at the Boys' and Girls' Club.
    She upcycles thrifted garments into children's clothes and stylish outfits for herself. Dr. Doe has an active speech schedule that has taken her
    to Egypt, Japan, China, and across the U.S.A. In the summer she enjoys an active adult kickball league outdoors and retreats inside during the winter
    with volleyball. Catch her at the latest art gallery or movie premiere in the meantime.
    <br>
    Dr. Doe is able to remain active in these activities through the new immunotherapies for liver cancer. She invites you to help her continue her
    life's journey through well-wishes and a generous donation to the research keeping her thriving.
